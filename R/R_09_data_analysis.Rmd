# R: Data Analysis

## Data analysis methods

Let's start with loading the tidyverse library:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
library(kableExtra)
formatted_table <- function(df){
  kbl(df) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))
}
```

Here we will focus on data transformation and analysis.
We will filter rows with filter(), arrange rows with arrange() and select columns with select().
In addition, we will make grouped summaries using summarize().
At last, we will do some basic calculations. Note that plotting data will be the subject of the next section.

>Note: R is like a swiss army knife. Extremely powerfull but also very eloborate.
>It is impossible to cover all analysis functions of R.
>So this is not a complete guide for data analysis. Instead, this course will focus on some common tasks.
>You can always elaborate your analysis by exploring the tidyverse documentation. Or even use the base R documentation if the specific task you want to perform some custom tasks.
>See: [tidyverse documentation](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html)
>See: [base R documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html)

## Loading a dataset

As an example data set, we will be using the same data set as used in the Excel section:
namely, the Dementia Patient Health,Prescriptions ML Dataset.

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_09_data_analysis/file01_dementia_patients_health_data.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
formatted_table(head(df))
```

As you can see above, the data is loaded well. Also note that the columns are of the correct data type (e.g. dbl for the Calories column).


## Select rows by index

You can select rows by index using the following notation:

```{r}
formatted_table(df[2, ]) #select second row
```

Note the comma between the brackets. Since there is no specification of a column, all columns are selected.

## Select column by index


You can also select a column based on an index:

```{r}
formatted_table(head(df[, 8])) #select eighth column
```

The head function was used to truncate the output.

## Select column by name

You can also select a column by name:

```{r}
head(df$Prescription) #select column Prescription
```

Note that this action returns a vector instead of a dataframe.


## Select item by index

You can also select a specific item by index:

```{r}
formatted_table(df[2, 8]) #select second row and eighth column
```

Now we have the value of the second row and the eighth column.

## Filter rows

One of the most frequent tasks that you will be doing on data frames is filtering rows.
Here is how that works:

Filter rows on measured oxygen level in blood considered as normal:

```{r}
formatted_table(head(filter(df, BloodOxygenLevel > 95)))
```

Current smoker and normal blood oxygen levels:

```{r}
formatted_table(head(filter(df, Smoking_Status == "Current Smoker" & BloodOxygenLevel > 95)))
```

NOT a current smoker and normal blood oxygen levels:

```{r}
formatted_table(head(filter(df, !Smoking_Status == "Current Smoker" & BloodOxygenLevel > 95)))
```

Normal blood oxygen levels or very low blood oxygen levels:

```{r}
formatted_table(head(filter(df, BloodOxygenLevel < 92 | BloodOxygenLevel > 95)))
```

All patients of age 65:

```{r}
formatted_table(head(filter(df, Age == 65)))
```

## Arranging rows

You can use arrange() instead of filter if you want to sort your rows in a data frame instead of filtering it:

Arrange on blood oxygen levels **ascending** (from low to high values):

```{r}
formatted_table(head(arrange(df, BloodOxygenLevel)))
```


If you want to sort in **descending** order (from high to low values):

```{r}
formatted_table(head(arrange(df, desc(BloodOxygenLevel))))
```

And to select the row with the highest value:

```{r}
formatted_table(arrange(df, desc(BloodOxygenLevel))[1, ])
```

You can also do some multi-level sorting:

Here is an example of sorting on age first and then sorting on blood oxygen levels: 

```{r}
formatted_table(head(arrange(df, Age, BloodOxygenLevel)))
```

Here is an example of sorting on age first and then sorting on blood oxygen levels from high to low: 

```{r}
formatted_table(head(arrange(df, Age, desc(BloodOxygenLevel))))
```


>Note: Missing values will always be sorted at the end.


## Select columns with select

You have learned that Variables in data sets should be arranged in columns. Often data sets contain a lot of variables (columns). Most likely, you are not interested in all of them.
With the `select` function, you can select the variables that you are interested in:

```{r}
formatted_table(head(select(df, Age, Smoking_Status, BloodOxygenLevel, HeartRate)))
```

Or select all columns except the blood oxygen levels:

```{r}
formatted_table(head(select(df, -BloodOxygenLevel)))
```

Or select besides the age, all columns with "Level" in the name:

```{r}
formatted_table(head(select(df, Age, ends_with("Level"))))
```


## Summary data

You can use the base R `summary` function to get summary information on a data frame:

```{r}
summary(df)
```

As this output can be quit overwhelming you may select for the data that you are interested in (for example blood oxygen levels):

```{r}
summary(df$BloodOxygenLevel)
```

But the Tidyverse library also contains a `summarize` function:

```{r}
formatted_table(summarize(df, BloodOxygenLevel = mean(BloodOxygenLevel)))
```

You can combine this with the `group_by` function for powerful analysis:

```{r}
by_smoking_status <- group_by(df, Smoking_Status)
formatted_table(summarize(by_smoking_status, Average_BloodOxygenLevel = mean(BloodOxygenLevel)))
```

Recall that this looks very much like the pivot table function in Excel (see figure 28 at [data analysis Excel](https://bml-research.github.io/data_analysis/excel/excel_08_data_analysis.html)).

To create a similar output as the pivot tables in Excel:

```{r}
by_smoking_status <- group_by(df, Smoking_Status)
formatted_table(summarize(by_smoking_status, average_BOL = mean(BloodOxygenLevel), average_BT = mean(BodyTemperature)))
```


Now compare this output with figure 28 at [data analysis Excel](https://bml-research.github.io/data_analysis/excel/excel_08_data_analysis.html).

Likewise, you can extend this by providing the standard deviation:

```{r}
by_smoking_status <- group_by(df, Smoking_Status)
formatted_table(summarize(by_smoking_status, average_BOL = mean(BloodOxygenLevel), sd_BOL = sd(BloodOxygenLevel), average_BT = mean(BodyTemperature), sd_BT = sd(BodyTemperature)))
```

## Round values

In R you can round functions using the round() function:

```{r}
round(2.40, digits = 1)
round(2.45, digits = 1)
round(2.45) #defaults to 0 digits
round(2.5) #defaults to 0 digits
```

>Note that for rounding off a 5, the IEC 60559 standard (see also ‘IEEE 754’) is expected to be used, ‘go to the even digit’. Therefore round(0.5) is 0 and round(-1.5) is -2.

So if you like your values to be rounded in the example above, just wrap it in the round function:

```{r}
by_smoking_status <- group_by(df, Smoking_Status)
formatted_table(summarize(by_smoking_status, average_BOL = round(mean(BloodOxygenLevel), digits = 1), sd_BOL = round(sd(BloodOxygenLevel), digits = 2), average_BT = round(mean(BodyTemperature), digits = 1), sd_BT = round(sd(BodyTemperature), digits = 2)))
```

## Statistics

R is build for statistics so you can do all kind of sophisticated statistics in R.
As this is not a statistics course, the use of statistics is beyond the scope of this course.

Some very basic functions that might be useful (all applied on the BloodOxygenLevel column):

```{r}
paste("mean:", round(mean(df$BloodOxygenLevel), digits = 3))
paste("min:", round(min(df$BloodOxygenLevel), digits = 2))
paste("max:", round(max(df$BloodOxygenLevel), digits = 2))
paste("median:", round(median(df$BloodOxygenLevel), digits = 2))
round(quantile(df$BloodOxygenLevel, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)), digits = 2)
paste("standard deviation:", round(sd(df$BloodOxygenLevel), digits = 3))
paste("standard error of the mean:", round(sd(df$BloodOxygenLevel)/sqrt(length(df$BloodOxygenLevel)), digits = 3)) #can also be calculated using the plotrix package
```

## Summarize each

Using Tidyverse, you can also apply some of the above statistics more conveniently using the `summarize_each` function:

```{r}
by_smoking_status <- group_by(df, Smoking_Status)
formatted_table(summarize_each(by_smoking_status, funs(mean, sd, se=sd(.)/sqrt(n()))))
```

Note: that the `se=sd(.)/sqrt(n())` code is a custom made function to calculate the standard error of the mean.

Columns with characters cannot be used to do these kind of calculations. If you check the complete formatted table you will find that these are empty (`NA`). For example the column for Prescription; it is not possible to calculate the mean value for character type of data (in this case: name of the medicine). So it is best to omit them:

```{r}
by_smoking_status <- group_by(df, Smoking_Status)
formatted_table(summarize_each(by_smoking_status, funs(mean, sd, se=sd(.)/sqrt(n()))) %>%
                       select(-Prescription_mean))
```

We could simplify the second expression by using pipes.You can use `%>%` to emphasize a sequence of actions.

```{r}
formatted_table(df %>%
                  group_by(Smoking_Status) %>%
                  summarize_each(funs(mean, sd, se=sd(.)/sqrt(n()))) %>%
                  select(-Prescription_mean))
```

Piping greatly reduces the complexity of your actions and prevents the creation of temporary variables.
You can read it as:
First take the data frame `df` then,
group the data frame by the items in the column `Smoking_Status` and then,
summarize each `Smoking_Status` item for `mean`, `sd` and `se` and then,
select all columns except `Prescription`.

In this case, we can also remove all character type columns at once (and then do the calculations) with the `select_if` function.

```{r}
by_smoking_status <- select_if(group_by(df, Smoking_Status), is.numeric)
formatted_table(summarize_each(by_smoking_status, funs(mean, sd, se=sd(.)/sqrt(n()))))
```
This way, the only character type column that is preserved is the Smoking_Status column.
Note: there are still fields with `NA` in this overview. These are caused by missing values in the original dataset. If you try to calculate the mean value of a set of numbers, including `NA`, the result will be `NA`:

```{r}
paste("mean with no `NA` values:", mean(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, 4.6, 7.9)))
paste("mean with `NA` values:", mean(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, NA, 7.9)))
paste("standard deviation with no `NA` values:", sd(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, 4.6, 7.9)))
paste("standard deviation with `NA` values:", sd(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, NA, 7.9)))
paste("sum with no `NA` values:", sum(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, 4.6, 7.9)))
paste("sum with `NA` values:", sum(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, NA, 7.9)))
```
We can get around this problem using the `na.rm =` argument in the functions used. The default setting is `na.rm = FALSE`. If we set this argument to `TRUE`, all `NA` values will be removed before the mean/sd/sum is calculated.

```{r}
paste("mean with no `NA` values:", mean(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, 4.6, 7.9)))
paste("mean with `NA` values:", mean(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, NA, 7.9), na.rm = TRUE))
paste("standard deviation with no `NA` values:", sd(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, 4.6, 7.9)))
paste("standard deviation with `NA` values:", sd(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, NA, 7.9), na.rm = TRUE))
paste("sum with no `NA` values:", sum(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, 4.6, 7.9)))
paste("sum with `NA` values:", sum(c(5.7, 3.5, 2.7, NA, 7.9), na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Summarize and across

The summarize_each() function is deprecated (will work, but not actively maintained anymore) in favor of the new across() function that works within summarize() and mutate().  

```{r}
formatted_table(df %>%
  group_by(Smoking_Status) %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), list(mean = mean, sd = sd))))
```

Or use the scoped variant of summarize, summarize_all:  

```{r}
df_summary <- df %>%
  group_by(Smoking_Status) %>%
  summarize_all(list(mean = mean, sd = sd))

formatted_table(df_summary)
```

If you want to remove the columns that yield NA’s:  

```{r}
df_summary %>% select_if(~sum(!is.na(.)) > 0)
```
