# R

## Data Cleaning Exercises

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

This file can be downloaded [here](./R_07_data_cleaning_exercises.Rmd)

### Exercise 1

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise01/Heart_Disease_Prediction.xlsx) first data set was not loaded well in Excel. Load the Excel file as a tibble in R. Separate the columns correctly.
*Hint:* use the `separate_wider_delim` function from tidyverse. Consult the information on this function with `?separate_wider_delim`. On the bottom you will find examples you can run. Take a close look at the first example. This should give you a clue how to solve this problem.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 2

The data in [this](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise02/fish_data_mod.csv) file contains the units in the cells. This makes it impossible to perform calculations (as the data type is a text string). Remove the units in order to make calculations possible.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 3

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise03/Heart_Disease_Prediction_mod.xlsx) data set contains rows with duplicate data. Load the data and remove the duplicates from the data table.

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exercise 4

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise04/CHEMBL1989.csv) data set contains empty data.
Make the empty elements more explicit in R by converting them to `NA`.
Count how many elements you have:

- in total
- with missing data
- without missing data

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exercise 5

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise05/CHEMBL1989_mod.csv) also contains missing data in many fields. However, instead of leaving the cells empty, the author used a character to indicate a missing value. Open the file in a text editor to find what character has been used for missing data and replace this character with `NA`.

```{r}
#Your code here
```
