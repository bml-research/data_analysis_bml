## Data Cleaning Solutions

Loading Tidyverse:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

>The following function is used to print tibbles in a proper way for the web. You can skip the use of this function to print tibbles to your screen in R Markdown documents.


```{r}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(pillar)

formatted_table <- function(df) {
  col_types <- sapply(df, pillar::type_sum)
  new_col_names <- paste0(names(df), "<br>", "<span style='font-weight: normal;'>", col_types, "</span>")
  kbl(df, 
      col.names = new_col_names, 
      escape = FALSE, # This is crucial to allow the <br> tag to work
      format = "html" # Ensure HTML format, although often auto-detected
      ) %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))
}
```

### Exercise 1

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise01/Heart_Disease_Prediction.xlsx) first data set was not loaded well in Excel. Load the Excel file as a tibble in R. Separate the columns correctly.
*Hint:* use the `separate_wider_delim` function from tidyverse. Consult the information on this function with `?separate_wider_delim`. On the bottom you will find examples you can run. Take a close look at the first example. This should give you a clue how to solve this problem.

```{r}
library(readxl)
file_path <- "./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise01/Heart_Disease_Prediction.xlsx"
df <- read_excel(file_path)
colname <- "index$Age$Sex$Chest pain type$BP$Cholesterol$FBS over 120$EKG results$Max HR$Exercise angina$ST depression$Slope of ST$Number of vessels fluro$Thallium$Heart Disease"
df <- df %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(colname, delim = "$", names = c("index", "Age", "Sex", "Chest pain type" ,"BP", "Cholesterol", "FBS over 120", "EKG results", "Max HR", "Exercise angina", "ST depression", "Slope of ST", "Number of vessels fluro", "Thallium", "Heart Disease"))
formatted_table(head(df, c(6, 13)))
```


### Exercise 2

The data in [this](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise02/fish_data_mod.csv) file contains the units in the cells. This makes it impossible to perform calculations (as the data type is a text string). Remove the units in order to make calculations possible.

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise02/fish_data_mod.csv"
df <- read_csv2(file_path)
df <- df %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(average_length, delim = " ", names = c("average_length", "length_unit")) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(average_weight, delim = " ", names = c("average_weight", "weight_unit")) %>%
  separate_wider_delim(life_span, delim = " ", names = c("life_span", "time_unit")) %>%
  select (-c(length_unit, weight_unit, time_unit)) %>% #Note that this is a negative selection. Selects all but the listed columns.
  mutate_at(c('average_length', 'average_weight', 'life_span'), as.numeric) #Creates numbers from strings. mutate_at acts on multiple columns
formatted_table(head(df))
```

### Exercise 3

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise03/Heart_Disease_Prediction_mod.xlsx) data set contains rows with duplicate data. Load the data and remove the duplicates from the data table.

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise03/Heart_Disease_Prediction_mod.xlsx"
df <- read_excel(file_path)
formatted_table(head(df, c(6, 13)))
```

Let's first find duplicate elements in the first column. The Index should be a unique number, so duplicates should be easily found in this column:

```{r}
df$index[duplicated(df$index)]
```

Or in tidyverse style:

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(duplicated(index)) %>%
  pull(index)
```


Yes, there seems to be duplicates of the rows with index numbers 8 (2 extra duplicates) and 10 (5 extra duplicates).  
NOTE: R shows the extra duplicates here (in total there are 3 rows with index 8 and 6 rows with index 10; see below).

Do the rows with index numbers 8 and 10 contain the same data?

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(index == 8) %>%
  formatted_table()
```

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(index == 10) %>%
  formatted_table()
```



Yes, the rows with index numbers 8 and 10 contain the same data in the rows.
Before we delete the duplicates, let us count the number of rows:

```{r}
nrow(df)
```


Now we can delete the duplicated rows:

```{r}
my_data_cleaned <- df[!duplicated(df$index), ]
formatted_table(head(my_data_cleaned, c(6,13)))
```

Or tidyverse style:

```{r}
my_data_cleaned <- df %>%
  # 1. Remove rows with duplicated 'index' values
  distinct(index, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  # 3. Select the first 13 columns
  select(1:13)
formatted_table(head(my_data_cleaned))
```


```{r}
nrow(my_data_cleaned)
```

Note that there are 270 rows in the above tibble. Seven rows less compared to the tibble we started with (277).

Check if we still have duplicated rows:

```{r}
my_data_cleaned$index[duplicated(my_data_cleaned$index)]
```

This yielded an empty vector meaning the tibble does not contain duplicated rows anymore.

### Exercise 4

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise04/CHEMBL1989.csv) data set contains empty data.
Make the empty elements more explicit in R by converting them to `NA`.

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise04/CHEMBL1989.csv"
df <- read_csv(file_path)
formatted_table(head(df, c(6, 5)))
```

You see that also the `read_csv` function automatically replaces empty fields with `NA`.

Count how many elements you have:

- in total
- with missing data
- without missing data

```{r}
paste("total elements:", nrow(df), "x", ncol(df), "=", nrow(df) * ncol(df))
paste("empty elements:", sum(is.na(df)))
paste("non-empty elements:", sum(!is.na(df)))
```


### Exercise 5

[This](./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise05/CHEMBL1989_mod.csv) also contains missing data in many fields. However, instead of leaving the cells empty, the author used a character to indicate a missing value. Open the file in a text editor to find what character has been used for missing data and replace this character with `NA`.

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_07_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise05/CHEMBL1989_mod.csv"
df <- read_csv2(file_path)
df <- df %>% 
  replace(. == "-", NA)
formatted_table(head(df, c(6, 5)))
```
