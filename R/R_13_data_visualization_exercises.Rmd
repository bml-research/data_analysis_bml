```


This file can be found [here](./R_13_data_visualization_exercises.Rmd)

> The exercises will be similar to the exercises in Excel in order to compare the results.

### Exercise 1

Load the [Food Emissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandaroseknudsen/foodproductemissions?resource=download) dataset from Kaggle.

Create a column chart for the `Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg` per `food product`.

Annotate the axis and add a proper title.

What food product creates the highest Emission value?

```{r}
#Your code here
```



### Exercise 2

As the differences in the values are rather high, it is wise to use a log scale to display your data. Log scales have their advantages and are often used to display data that cover a wide range of values. Use a 2log scale to display your data.

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exercise 3

From the previous data set, filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a clustered column chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 4

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a stacked column chart. Filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a stacked column chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.

```{r}
#Your code here
```


### Exercise 5

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a relative stacked column chart. Filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a relative stacked column chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 6

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a pie chart. Filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a pie chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title, data labels and a legend.

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 7

Download the [data set about](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/calories-in-food-items-per-100-grams) food calories per 100 g. 

The data set contains units in the cells.  
First clean the data set.  
Create a box plot for `Energy per 100 g in KJ` plotted against the `Food Categories`.  

Which two Food Categories show the highest energy per weight?

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 8

In [this dataset](./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise08/ChickWeight.csv) you can find Chick Weight data. It shows the weight (in grams) on day 42 for various chickens that were fed with various diets during 42 days.

Create a radar chart for the various diets on day 42.  
Calculate the average weight per diet.

Two Chickens on a certain diet clearly gained the most weight.  
Which two chickens on which diet generated the highest weight gains?  

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 9

Have look at the data [here](./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise09/data.csv)
It contains data about Potassium and Sodium content (in mg/100 g) as well as calories (in kcal/100 g).  

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends ingestion of less than 2000 mg of sodium per day and more than 3510 mg of potassium per day, resulting in a Na-to-K ratio of â‰¤1.0, which is believed to be optimal for preserving cardiovascular health.

In addition, high caloric food is often bad for cardiovascular health.  

As you can see, only the K-to-Na ratio is calculated.   
Create a bubble chart with the Na concentration as a function of the K concentration.  
The bubble size should be based on the calorie values.  

Which two food items would be considered most healthy food items based on the information above?  

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 10

In [this dataset](./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise10/meat-production-tonnes.csv) you can find World wide meat production from 1961 to 2021 expressed in tonnes. It includes cattle, poultry, sheep/mutton, goat, pig meat, and wild game (source: https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production). 

Create a XY-scatter plot with the total production of meat (in tonnes) plotted against time for the Asian continent.  

Use Scientific notation for the mass meat production.  

```{r}
#Your code here
```

### Exercise 11

For this exercise, we will use the data set from exercise 7 again. This time, to create a `pivot table and plot` (note that there are no real pivot tables and plots in R).

Download the [data set about](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/calories-in-food-items-per-100-grams) food calories per 100 g. 

The data set contains units in the cells.  
First clean the data set.  
Create a pivot plot for the **mean** `Energy per 100 g in KJ` plotted against the `Food Categories`.  

Which two Food Categories show the highest mean energy per weight?
 
```{r}
