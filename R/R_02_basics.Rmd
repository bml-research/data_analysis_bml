# R: Basics of R

## Basics of R

Before we start with importing data, some basics of R will be explained. Remember that we will try to avoid basic programming and focus on the use of the functions and tools provided by the Tidyverse library.
  

## RStudio

Before you can start doing data analysis, you need to install both R and RStudio.
Have a look at [this website](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) how to do this.


We will work mostly with R-Markdown documents.
This webpage that you are reading is currently in HTML but was written as a RMarkdown document in RStudio.

Have a look at the screenshot below:

![](./pics_02_basics/fig01.png)

The RStudio user interface has 4 primary panes:
From top left to bottom left in clockwise direction these are:  
- *Source pane*.  
- *Console pane*.  
- *Environment pane*, containing the Environment, History, Connections, Build, VCS , and Tutorial tabs.  
- *Output pane*, containing the Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, and Presentation tabs.  

Note that these panes might be at a different location on your screen and that you can set the panes to your preference.
RMarkdown is very convenient because you can mix the markdown markup language with R code.

There is very comprehensive documentation about R Markdown. See [this webpage](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
  

### Some very basics of R

Although we will try to avoid base R as much as possible, you will need a bit of basics.

We can assign a variable in R as follows:

```{r}
x <- 42
print(x)
```

In this example, the number *42* is stored in the variable *x*.  

It is possible to store more than one number in a variable. The very basic data structure of R is the vector, which can contain multiple numbers.

It may contain whole numbers:

```{r}
my_nums <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
print(my_nums)
```

Or decimals:

```{r}
my_dec <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)
print(my_dec)
```

But also text:

```{r}
my_txt <- c("Hello", "World")
print(my_txt)
```

Or Boolean:

```{r}
my_bools <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
print(my_bools)
```

You can write these Boolean values also with a shorthand:

```{r}
my_bools <- c(T, F)
print(my_bools)
```

But what we will use is the data frame. See it as a bunch of columns stitched together:

```{r}
my_df <- data.frame(my_nums, my_dec)
print(my_df)
```

Both the `c` and `data.frame` are functions in R.
You can call them using `function.name()` and pass data to it as arguments.

So in the above code the vectors assigned to the variable names `my_nums` and `my_dec` are transferred as arguments in the `data.frame()` function. 
This function returns a data frame object that is assigned to the `my_df` variable name.

  
## Installing libraries

You can install the Tidyverse library using:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If you encounter problems with dependencies try:

```
install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)
```
  
## Loading packages:

You can load a package as follows:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

  
## Make a tibble

Now we can make a fancy type of data frame from the `Tidyverse` library:


```{r}
my_tibble <- tibble(my_df)
my_tibble
```

Tibbles do have some advantageous over base R data frames such as:  
- Tibbles only print the first 10 rows and all the columns that fit on a screen.  
- Each column displays its data type.

>As we are using the Tidyverse library during this course, we will use the Tidyverse main data type: The Tibble.
  
## Pimping tibbles

Tibbles look nice in RMarkdown documents but look very basic in html documents.
To create nice looking tibbles, we can use the `kableExtra` library:

See for documentation [this](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) page.


First we load the library:

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
```

And then we create a nice looking table:

```{r}
kbl(my_tibble) %>%
  kable_material()
```

You can do a lot of styling here. Example of using a dark theme:

```{r}
kbl(my_tibble) %>%
  kable_material_dark()
```

But I prefer the Twitter Bootstrap theme with striped rows that light up when you hover over it and that scales nicely on small screens like phones (you will get a horizontal slider when horizontal space is limited):

```{r}
kbl(my_tibble) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))
```


## Functions

In addition to the functions that R and it's packages have to offer, you can write your own functions. While creating your own functions is a bit out of scope of this course, I will provide an example below to re-use code to create the formatted tables as shown above.

```{r}
formatted_table <- function(df){
  kbl(df) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))
}
```


Now you can print the formatted table by calling the function and passing the tibble as argument without writing the whole code each time:

```{r}
formatted_table(my_tibble)
```

  
This also shows the power of R over Excel: several repetitive actions can be collected in a function so you can perform the same action on a different data set, while in Excel you will have to do all the actions by hand with each new data set.


## Learn the basics by doing

Go to the [exercises](https://bml-research.github.io/data_analysis_bml/R/R_02_basics_exercises.html) to get yourself familiar with the basics of R. This exercise consists of many small exercises that will guide you step-by-step through all the basics. It is essential that you practice a bit with base R before continuing with tidyverse.  

You can find the solutions [here](https://bml-research.github.io/data_analysis_bml/R/R_02_basics_solutions.html).
