> The exercises will be similar to the exercises in Excel in order to compare the results.

### Exercise 1

Load the [Food Emissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandaroseknudsen/foodproductemissions?resource=download) data set from Kaggle.

Create a column chart for the `Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg` per `food product`.

Annotate the axis and add a proper title.

What food product creates the highest Emission value?

```{r}
file_path_ex1 <- "./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise01/Food_Product_Emissions.csv"
df_ex1 <- read_csv(file_path_ex1)
formatted_table(head(df_ex1))
```

```{r}
barplot(df_ex1$`Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg`, 
        ylab = "Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg", 
        ylim = c(0, max(df_ex1$`Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg` + 20)), 
        names = df_ex1$`Food product`, 
        las = 2,
        cex.names = 0.5,
        col = "steelblue",
        main = "Food Product Emissions")  
```

Highest is Beef (Beef Herd)

### Exercise 2

As the differences in the values are rather high, it is wise to use a log scale to display your data. Log scales have their advantages and are often used to display data that cover a wide range of values. Use a 2log scale to display your data.

Example of using log:

```{r}
log2(8)
```

```{r}
`Log2 Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg` <- log2(df_ex1$`Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg`)
df_ex2 <- df_ex1 %>%
  add_column(`Log2 Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg`)
formatted_table(head(df_ex2))
```


```{r}
barplot(df_ex2$`Log2 Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg`, 
        ylab = "Log2 Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg", 
        ylim = c(min(df_ex2$`Log2 Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg` - 4), max(df_ex2$`Log2 Total Global Average GHG Emissions per kg` + 4)), 
        names = df_ex2$`Food product`, 
        las = 2,
        cex.names = 0.5,
        col = "steelblue",
        main = "Food Product Emissions")  
```

Note that this plot differs from the Excel counterpart. Here I calculated the 2log values (for example: the highest value is around 100. log2(100) = 6.6) and plotted the 2log GHG values on a linear y-scale while in the Excel counterpart, I plotted the GHG values on a 2log scaled y-axis. Both are permitted as long as you clearly indicate what is plotted on the y-axis. Note that values below 1 become negative on a log scale (log2(1) = 0 and log2(0.5) = -1).


### Exercise 3

From the previous data set, filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a clustered column chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.


First we create a df with the rows of Oil products:
```{r}
df_ex3 <- df_ex1[str_detect(df_ex1$`Food product`, "Oil"), ]
formatted_table(df_ex3)
```
Remove the columns that we do not need:

```{r}
df_ex3$`Land Use Change` <- NULL
df_ex3$Feed <- NULL
df_ex3 <- df_ex3[, 1:6]
formatted_table(df_ex3)
```

Make the df tidy:
```{r}
tidy_df_ex3 <- df_ex3 %>%
  gather(`Farm`, `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging`, `Retail`, key = "Emission origin", value = "Emission per kg")
formatted_table(head(tidy_df_ex3))
```



```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = tidy_df_ex3, aes(x = `Food product`, y = `Emission per kg`, fill = `Emission origin`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="dodge") +
  labs(title="Food Product Emissions") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
p
```


### Exercise 4

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a stacked column chart. Filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a stacked column chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = tidy_df_ex3, aes(x = `Food product`, y = `Emission per kg`, fill = `Emission origin`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="stack") +
  labs(title="Food Product Emissions") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
p
```



### Exercise 5

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a relative stacked column chart. Filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a relative stacked column chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = tidy_df_ex3, aes(x = `Food product`, y = `Emission per kg`, fill = `Emission origin`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="fill") +
  labs(title="Food Product Emissions") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
p
```


### Exercise 6

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a pie chart. Filter the data that contain oil in the name.  
Create a pie chart representing the Emissions per kg from `Processing`, `Transport`, `Packaging` and `Retail`. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title, data labels and a legend.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(tidy_df_ex3, aes(x = "", y = `Emission per kg`, fill = `Emission origin`)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  labs(title="Food Product Emissions") +
  theme_void() # remove background, grid, numeric labels
p
```


### Exercise 7

Download the [data set about](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/calories-in-food-items-per-100-grams) food calories per 100 g. 

The data set contains units in the cells.  
First clean the data set.  
Create a box plot for `Energy per 100 g in KJ` plotted against the `Food Categories`.  

Which two Food Categories show the highest energy per weight?

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise07/calories.csv"
df_ex7 <- read_csv(file_path)
formatted_table(head(df_ex7))
```

Now we need to clean it:
```{r}
df_ex7 <- df_ex7 %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(Cals_per100grams, delim = " ", names = c("Cals_per100grams", "waste")) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(KJ_per100grams, delim = " ", names = c("KJ_per100grams", "waste2")) %>%
  select (-c(waste, waste2)) %>% #Note that this is a negative selection. Selects all but the listed columns.
  mutate_at(c('Cals_per100grams', 'KJ_per100grams'), as.numeric) #Creates numbers from strings
formatted_table(head(df_ex7))
```

Create Box plot:
```{r}
p <- ggplot(df_ex7, aes(x = `FoodCategory`, y = `KJ_per100grams`)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Energy per weight in different food categories") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1)) +
  ylab("Energy Density (KJ per 100 grams)") +
  xlab("Food Category")
p
```

Highest: Oils and Fats and Vegetable Oils

### Exercise 8

In [this dataset](./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise08/ChickWeight.csv) you can find Chick Weight data. It shows the weight (in grams) on day 42 for various chickens that were fed with various diets during 42 days.

Create a radar chart for the various diets on day 42.  
Calculate the average weight per diet.

Two Chickens on a certain diet clearly gained the most weight.  
Which two chickens on which diet generated the highest weight gains?  

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise08/ChickWeight.csv"
df_ex8 <- read_tsv(file_path)
formatted_table(df_ex8)
```

```{r}
library(ggradar)
```

For a radar chart we need to scale the data from 0-1

```{r}
df_ex8_scaled <- df_ex8[, -1]/400
formatted_table(df_ex8_scaled)
```

Grab the first column:

```{r}
first_col <- df_ex8[, 1]
formatted_table(first_col)
```
And add together:

```{r}
df_ex8_mod <- cbind(first_col, df_ex8_scaled)
formatted_table(df_ex8_mod)
```

And now we can create the plot:
```{r}
p <- ggradar(df_ex8_mod,  legend.text.size = 8, values.radar = c("0", "200", "400"), axis.label.size = 3, grid.label.size = 3, legend.position = "right") +
  labs(title = "Chick weight from different diets at day 42") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, ))
p
```
Chick 4 and 5 gained the highest weight (on Diet 3).

### Exercise 9

Have look at the data [here](./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise09/data.csv)
It contains data about Potassium and Sodium content (in mg/100 g) as well as calories (in kcal/100 g).  

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends ingestion of less than 2000 mg of sodium per day and more than 3510 mg of potassium per day, resulting in a Na-to-K ratio of â‰¤1.0, which is believed to be optimal for preserving cardiovascular health.

In addition, high caloric food is often bad for cardiovascular health.  

As you can see, only the K-to-Na ratio is calculated.   
Create a bubble chart with the Na concentration as a function of the K concentration.  
The bubble size should be based on the calorie values.  

Which two food items would be considered most healthy food items based on the information above?  

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise09/data.csv"
df_ex9 <- read_delim(file_path, delim=" ")
df_ex9$...6 <- NULL
formatted_table(head(df_ex9))
```
```{r}
p <- ggplot(df_ex9, aes(x = `Potassium_conc`, y = `Sodium_conc`)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = `Calories`), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size(range = c(0.5, 12)) +
  geom_text(aes(label=Item)) +
  xlab("Potassium concentration (mg/100 g)") +
  ylab("Sodium concentration (mg/100 g)")
p
```
Spinach and Parsley are low Caloric and have a high Potassium concentration and low sodium concentration.

### Exercise 10

In [this dataset](./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise10/meat-production-tonnes.csv) you can find World wide meat production from 1961 to 2021 expressed in tonnes. It includes cattle, poultry, sheep/mutton, goat, pig meat, and wild game (source: https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production). 

Create a XY-scatter plot with the total production of meat (in tonnes) plotted against time for the Asian continent.  

Use Scientific notation for the mass meat production.  

```{r}
file_path <- "./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise10/meat-production-tonnes.csv"
df_ex10 <- read_csv(file_path)
df_ex10 <- rename(df_ex10, `Total mass (tonnes)`= `Meat, total | 00001765 || Production | 005510 || tonnes`)
formatted_table(head(df_ex10))
```

Filter the data to be used:
```{r}
df_ex10_asia <- df_ex10 %>%
  filter(Entity == "Asia")
formatted_table(head(df_ex10_asia))
```

Create the plot:
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data= df_ex10_asia, aes(x = Year, y = `Total mass (tonnes)`)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title="Meat production in Asia")
p
```
Or without line (just the data points):

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data= df_ex10_asia, aes(x = Year, y = `Total mass (tonnes)`)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="Meat production in Asia")
p
```

### Exercise 11

For this exercise, we will use the data set from exercise 7 again. This time, to create a `pivot table and plot` (note that there are no real pivot tables and plots in R).

Download the [data set about](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/calories-in-food-items-per-100-grams) food calories per 100 g. 

The data set contains units in the cells.  
First clean the data set.  
Create a pivot plot for the **mean** `Energy per 100 g in KJ` plotted against the `Food Categories`.  

Which two Food Categories show the highest mean energy per weight?
 
```{r}
file_path <- "./files_13_data_visualization_exercises/exercise11/calories.csv"
df_ex11 <- read_csv(file_path)
formatted_table(head(df_ex11))
```
Clean the data:

```{r}
df_ex11 <- df_ex11 %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(Cals_per100grams, delim = " ", names = c("Cals_per100grams", "waste")) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(KJ_per100grams, delim = " ", names = c("KJ_per100grams", "waste2")) %>%
  select (-c(waste, waste2)) %>% #Note that this is a negative selection. Selects all but the listed columns.
  mutate_at(c('Cals_per100grams', 'KJ_per100grams'), as.numeric) #Creates numbers from strings
formatted_table(head(df_ex11))
```


Now group the food Categories:
```{r}
df_ex11_summ <- df_ex11 %>% 
  group_by(FoodCategory) %>% 
  summarize("Energy density (KJ/100 g)" = round(mean(`KJ_per100grams`), 1))
formatted_table(head(df_ex11_summ))
```

And now we can create the plot:
```{r}
barplot(df_ex11_summ$`Energy density (KJ/100 g)`, 
        ylab = "Energy density (KJ/100 g)", 
        ylim = c(0, max(df_ex11_summ$`Energy density (KJ/100 g)` + 1000)), 
        names = df_ex11_summ$`FoodCategory`, 
        las = 2,
        cex.names = 0.5,
        col = "steelblue",
        main = "Energy Density per food catagory")  
```


Oils & Fats as well as VegetableOils show the highest mean energy density.
