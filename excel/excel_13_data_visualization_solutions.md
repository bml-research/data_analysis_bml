## Solutions

---

### Exercise 1

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise01/exercise01.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below:

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise01/fig01.png)


There are 19 genes that pass this criteria. 
As you can see, they are sorted lowest to highest.

### Exercise 2

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise02/exercise02.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below:

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise02/fig01.png)

### Exercise 3

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise03/exercise03.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below:

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise03/fig01.png)

### Exercise 4

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise04/exercise04.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below:

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise04/fig01.png)


### Exercise 5

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise05/exercise05.xlsx) for the solution.

First we need to sum each of the different categories.
The `UNIQUE()` function can be used to retrieve the unique categories.
The `SUMIF()` function can be used to calculate the sum of each category for the Expression values without stimulus.

Thereafter, a PIE chart can be generated.

Or the figure below:

### Exercise 6

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise06/exercise06.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below:

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise06/fig01.png)

Signal transduction proteins shows the lowest median.  

### Exercise 7

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise07/exercise07.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below:

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise07/fig01.png)

Signal transduction proteins shows the lowest IQR (lowest height of the Whisker box).  


### Exercise 8

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise08/exercise08.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below:

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise08/fig01.png)

Chicken number 4 and 5 on Diet number 3 gained the most in weight.  


### Exercise 9

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise09/exercise09.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below:

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise09/fig01.png)

Alice shows a relatively low concentration of potassium for the sodium concentration (or a relatively low sodium concentration for the potassium concentration).  

### Exercise 10

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise10/exercise10.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below for the line plot (without Puromycin):

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise10/fig01.png)

Or the figure below for the line plot (with and without Puromycin):

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise10/fig02.png)

Puromycin acts as an activator.

### Exercise 11

Data can be cleaned in various ways. You can use (for instance) the text-to-columns feature to split on a space. But there are other strategies as well (like the `RIGHT` or `LEFT` formula).

See the Excel file [here](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise11/exercise11.xlsx) for the solution.

Or the figure below:

![figure](./files_13_data_visualization_solutions/exercise11/fig01.png)

Motor proteins show the highest expression levels.  
Signal transducing proteins the lowest expression values.
