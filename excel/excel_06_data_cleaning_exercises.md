# Excel Data Cleaning

## Exercises

---

### Exercise 1

[This](./files_06_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise01/Heart_Disease_Prediction.xlsx) first dataset was not loaded well. Use the text to column feature to correct it.
Source: [Predicting Heart Disease Using Clinical Variables](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/predicting-heart-disease-risk-using-clinical-var)

### Exercise 2

[This](./files_06_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise02/calories.xlsx) dataset is not loaded well. In addition, the file contains the units in the cells. This makes it impossible to perform calculations (as the data type is a text string). Remove the units in order to make calculations possible.

### Exercise 3

[This dataset](./files_06_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise03/Heart_Disease_Prediction_mod.csv) contains rows with duplicate data. Load the data and remove the duplicates from the data table.

### Exercise 4

[This dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/nutritional-values-for-common-foods-and-products) contains empty data.

Make the empty cells more explicit in Excel by converting them to #N/A.  
Count how many cells you have:
- in total
- with missing data
- without missing data
