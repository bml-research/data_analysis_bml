# Excel Data Cleaning

## Exercises

---

### Exercise 1

[This](./files_06_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise01/calories.xlsx) first dataset was not loaded well. Use the text to column feature to correct it.

### Exercise 2

The file from the previous exercise contains the units in the cells. This makes it impossible to perform calculations (as the data type is a text string). Remove the units in order to make calculations possible.

### Exercise 3

[This dataset](./files_06_data_cleaning_exercises/exercise03/Food%20Composition_mod.csv) contains rows with duplicate data. Load the data and remove the duplicates from the data table.
