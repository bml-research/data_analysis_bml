# Excel Data Import

## Exercises

---

### Exercise 1

Load the following datasets in Excel using the csv import functionality (Power Query). First have a look at them in your text editor.  
Then load in Excel.  

- [file 1](./files_03_data_import_exercises/fish_data_1.csv)  
- [file 2](./files_03_data_import_exercises/fish_data_2.csv)  
- [file 3](./files_03_data_import_exercises/fish_data_3.csv)  
- [file 4](./files_03_data_import_exercises/fish_data_4.csv)  

Report the field separator.

### Exercise 2

Load the [Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset) dataset in Excel using the csv import tool (Power Query). 

### Exercise 3

Load the [Properties of ATC accepted medicines](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tonibois/properties-of-atc-accepted-medicines) dataset in Excel using the csv import tool (Power Query).

### Exercise 4

Load the [food-allergens-and-allergies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/boltcutters/food-allergens-and-allergies) dataset in Excel using the csv import tool (Power Query).

### Exercise 5

Load the [Beta-Lactamase](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedataprof/betalactamase) dataset in Excel using the csv import tool (Power Query). This dataset contains several csv files. Just use the first (CHEMBL1989.csv)

### Exercise 6

Load the [SARS-CoV-2 Genetics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtwillett/sarscov2-genetics)
 dataset in Excel using the csv import tool (Power Query).
 There are two separate csv files. Load both in the same Excel file (albeit at different worksheets).  

>You can try to load more data from the [datasets web page](https://bml-research.github.io/data_analysis_bml/data_sets/data_sets.html).
>Alternatively, you can search for more datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/) or other dataset repositories. 

### Exercise 7

The zip file in [this link](./files_03_data_import_exercises/exercise07_files.zip) contains 25 small exercises to load data in Excel.  
Unpack the zip file and import the files using Power Query.  
Hint: first inspect the file using a text editor.  
Check for the following:
- What column delimiter is used?
- Are there top rows to be removed?
- What decimal separator is used?  
- Are there missing data? Replace to NA.
- Are column names present? If not, add them during loading in PowerQuery. You can take the column names from another file in the series.

Load the files using PowerQuery and do not modify the csv files from within a text editor!
