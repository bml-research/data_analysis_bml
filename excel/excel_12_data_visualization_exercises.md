# Excel Data Visualization

## Exercises

---

### Exercise 1

Load the [Following dataset](./files_12_data_visualization_exercises/exercise01/exercise01.csv).

It shows RNA expression data with and without a stimulus.

Create a column chart for the `MAP kinase Expression values without a stimulus with expression levels higher than 0.5.

Create the column chart on a new worksheet.
Annotate the axis and add a proper title.

Sort the expression values from low to high (the graph should contain bars with increasing height).

### Exercise 2

From the previous data set, use again the gene expression within the MAP Kinase gene family.
Create a clustered column chart representing the expression values without stimulus and the expression values with stimulus. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend. The gene names should be sorted.

### Exercise 3

Use the same data as from exercise 2 to create a stacked column chart. Filter the data that contain the MAP Kinase gene family.
Create a stacked column chart representing the Expression Values with and without stimulus. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend. The gene names should be sorted.

### Exercise 4

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a relative stacked column chart. Filter the data that contain the MAP Kinase gene family. Create a relative stacked column chart representing the Expression Values with and without stimulus. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend. The gene names should be sorted.

### Exercise 5

Use the same data as from exercise 3 to create a pie chart.
Create a pie chart representing the total Expression Value without stimulus per Category. Make sure to add proper axis titles, a title and a legend.

Which category shows the smallest fraction of expression value - stimulus?

### Exercise 6

For this exercise you will use the same data.
Create a box plot for Expression value - stimulus plotted against the Categories.  

Which category shows the lowest median value?

### Exercise 7

Download the [data set about](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/calories-in-food-items-per-100-grams) food calories per 100 g. 

The data set contains units in the cells.  
First clean the dataset.  
Create a box plot for `Energy per 100 g in KJ` plotted against the `Food Categories`.  

Which two Food Categories show the highest energy per weight?

### Exercise 8

In [this dataset](./files_12_data_visualization_exercises/exercise08/ChickWeight.csv) you can find Chick Weight data. It shows the weight (in grams) on day 42 for various chickens that were fed with various diets during 42 days.

Create a radar chart for the various diets on day 42.  
Calculate the average weight per diet.

Two Chickens on a certain diet clearly gained the most weight.  
Wich two chickens on which diet generated the highest weight gains?  

### Exercise 9

Have look at the data [here](./files_12_data_visualization_exercises/exercise09/data.csv)
It contains data about Potassium and Sodium content (in mg/100 g) as well as calories (in kcal/100 g).  

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends ingestion of less than 2000 mg of sodium per day and more than 3510 mg of potassium per day, resulting in a Na-to-K ratio of â‰¤1.0, which is believed to be optimal for preserving cardiovascular health.

In addition, high caloric food is often bad for cardiovascular health.  

As you can see, only the K-to-Na ratio is calculated.   
Create a bubble chart with the Na concentration as a function of the K concentration.  
The bubble size should be based on the calorie values.  

Which two food items would be considered most healthy food items based on the information above?  

### Exercise 10

In [this dataset](./files_12_data_visualization_exercises/exercise10/meat-production-tonnes.csv) you can find World wide meat production from 1961 to 2021 expressed in tonnes. It includes cattle, poultry, sheep/mutton, goat, pig meat, and wild game (source: https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production). 

Create a XY-scatter plot with the total production of meat (in tonnes) plotted against time for the asian continent.  

Use Scientific notation for the mass meat production.  

### Exercise 11

For this exercise, we will use the dataset from exercise 7 again. This time, to create a pivot table and plot.

Download the [data set about](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/calories-in-food-items-per-100-grams) food calories per 100 g. 

The data set contains units in the cells.  
First clean the dataset.  
Create a pivot plot for the **mean** `Energy per 100 g in KJ` plotted against the `Food Categories`.  

Which two Food Categories show the highest mean energy per weight?
