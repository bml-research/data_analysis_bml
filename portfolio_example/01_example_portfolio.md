# Example Portfolio

## Your Portfolio Assignment: A Guide to Success

This document outlines the requirements and expectations for your portfolio, designed to showcase your data analysis skills. Think of this as a structured project where you'll apply what you've learned to a real-world dataset. The provided example portfolio aims for a 7.5-8.0 level, but you can certainly aim higher!

## Your Workflow: Step-by-Step

Follow these steps to complete your portfolio effectively:

### Dataset Selection is Key:

Search for datasets, for example Kaggle (kaggle.com), and explore the vast collection of datasets. Choose one that genuinely interests you and allows for meaningful analysis relevant to topics covered. In particular, consider datasets from the field of Life Sciences but data sets from other fields are also allowed.  

Crucially, once you've selected your dataset, provide its direct link in the Excel file your instructor will provide. This step is vital to prevent duplicate datasets from being used by different students.

### Structure Your Portfolio:

Adhere strictly to the **example portfolio's** (see link below) structure. This ensures consistency and helps you present your analysis logically and comprehensively. Don't deviate from this framework unless explicitly instructed or if you have a compelling, justified reason.

### The Checklist

You'll receive a **checklist** (see link below) from your instructor. Go through each item on this list meticulously. For every point, not only check it off but also clearly justify within your portfolio how you've addressed that requirement. This might involve a dedicated section or integrated explanations throughout your analysis. This demonstration of compliance is essential for your grade.

### Submission

Once you're confident that all components are complete and polished, zip your folder and upload and share your zipped portfolio via BrightSpace.

### Review and Feedback:

Your instructor will evaluate your portfolio using the assessment shown below. Make sure you're familiar with this form beforehand to understand the grading criteria.
Following the review, you'll have a brief 15-minute CGI (Communication, Discussion, Insight) session with your instructor. This is your opportunity to discuss your work, answer any questions, and gain deeper insights into your performance.
Finally, you'll receive your motivated assessment and detailed feedback on your portfolio.

### Stronger Narratives and Interpretations

Don't just show plots; tell a story with your data. Clearly articulate what each visualization reveals, connect findings across different analyses, and draw insightful conclusions that directly address potential research questions or hypotheses.
Robust Justification: Consistently explain why you made certain decisions (e.g., why you chose a particular method for handling missing data, why a specific plot type was best suited for a certain variable).
By putting in the extra effort and thoughtful consideration, you can significantly enhance your portfolio and demonstrate a deeper understanding of data analysis principles. 

### Elevating Your Grade: Beyond the Basics

The example portfolio is a solid foundation, aiming for a 7.5-8.0. To achieve an even higher score, consider these enhancements:

- **Go Beyond Basic Analysis**: Don't just present descriptive statistics. Dive deeper with more advanced analytical techniques (for example, include statistical tests, basic predictive modeling such as linear regression) if applicable)
- **Expand Your Visualizations**: While standard plots (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) are necessary, incorporating additional, more complex plot types can significantly boost your score. 

Think about:
- Radar charts for comparing multiple quantitative variables of a few items.
- Bubble charts to visualize three dimensions of data in a two-dimensional plot.
- Heatmaps for complex correlation matrices or categorical relationships.
- Or by creatively utilizing other advanced or less common plot types from the extensive libraries offered by tools like Excel and R's ggplot2.


Good luck!
